# ✅ Storage Security Implementation - COMPLETE

## Summary

Supabase Storage security policies have been **successfully implemented and activated** for the `reference-images` bucket.

**Date Completed**: October 23, 2025
**Authentication Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE** (Email/Password with middleware protection)

---

## 🔒 Active Storage Policies

All 4 security policies are now enforced on `storage.objects`:

### 1. ✅ Authenticated Upload Policy
```sql
Policy: "Authenticated users can upload images"
Command: INSERT
Roles: authenticated
Restriction: bucket_id = 'reference-images'
            AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] IN ('originals', 'thumbnails')
```

**Updated**: October 23, 2025 - Fixed to use `storage.foldername()` helper function

**What it does**:
- Only **logged-in users** can upload images
- Uploads restricted to `originals/` and `thumbnails/` folders only
- Prevents unauthorized file uploads

**Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE AND ENFORCED**

---

### 2. ✅ Public Read Policy
```sql
Policy: "Allow public reads"
Command: SELECT
Roles: public
Restriction: bucket_id = 'reference-images'
```

**What it does**:
- Anyone can **view/download** images (no auth required)
- Required for gallery display and briefing image sharing
- Enables CDN caching for fast delivery

**Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE AND ENFORCED**

---

### 3. ✅ Authenticated Delete Policy
```sql
Policy: "Authenticated users can delete images"
Command: DELETE
Roles: authenticated
Restriction: bucket_id = 'reference-images'
```

**What it does**:
- Only **logged-in users** can delete images
- Prevents unauthorized file deletion
- Works with dashboard "Delete All Images" feature

**Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE AND ENFORCED**

---

### 4. ✅ No Update Policy (Immutability)
```sql
Policy: "No updates to images"
Command: UPDATE
Roles: authenticated
Restriction: false (always deny)
```

**What it does**:
- **Prevents all updates** to existing images
- Images are immutable once uploaded
- Must delete and re-upload if changes needed
- Prevents accidental overwrites

**Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE AND ENFORCED**

---

## 🛡️ Security Improvements Made

### Before (Insecure):
- ❌ **Public uploads allowed** - Anyone could upload files
- ❌ **No folder restrictions** - Files could be uploaded anywhere
- ❌ **No delete protection** - Anyone could delete files
- ❌ **Updates allowed** - Files could be overwritten

### After (Secure):
- ✅ **Authenticated uploads only** - Must be logged in
- ✅ **Folder restrictions enforced** - Only `originals/` and `thumbnails/`
- ✅ **Authenticated deletes only** - Must be logged in
- ✅ **Updates prevented** - Images are immutable
- ✅ **Public reads allowed** - For gallery viewing

## 🔐 Authentication System (Already Implemented)

Your app has a **fully functional authentication system**:

### Implementation Details:

**1. Middleware Protection** (`middleware.ts:76-91`)
```typescript
// Protects all /tagger routes
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()

if (!session) {
  // Redirect to login
  return NextResponse.redirect('/tagger/login?redirectTo=' + pathname)
}
```

**2. Email/Password Login** (`LoginClient.tsx:32`)
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email,
  password
})
```

**3. Supabase Clients** (`lib/supabase.ts`)
```typescript
// Client-side (authenticated users) - respects RLS
export const supabase = createClient(url, anonKey)

// Server-side (admin operations) - bypasses RLS
export const createServerClient = () =>
  createClient(url, serviceRoleKey)
```

---

## 📊 Current Upload Flow

### When a user uploads an image:

1. **User must be logged in** (middleware checks session)
2. **Client validates file** (Zod schema):
   - Max size: 10MB
   - Allowed types: JPG, PNG, WEBP
   - Filename sanitization
3. **Client uploads to Supabase Storage** (using `supabase` with anon key)
4. **RLS policy checks**:
   - ✅ Is user authenticated? (checks JWT token)
   - ✅ Is bucket = 'reference-images'?
   - ✅ Is folder 'originals' or 'thumbnails'?
5. **Upload succeeds** or **fails with 403 Forbidden**

**File**: `components/tagger/ImageTaggerClient.tsx:567-578`

---

## ✅ Verification Results

### Policy Query Results:
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd, roles FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'storage' AND tablename = 'objects';
```

**Results** (October 23, 2025):
| Policy Name | Command | Roles |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Authenticated users can upload images | INSERT | authenticated |
| Allow public reads | SELECT | public |
| Authenticated users can delete images | DELETE | authenticated |
| No updates to images | UPDATE | authenticated (always false) |

✅ **All 4 policies active and enforced**

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Test 1: Upload while logged in
- **Action**: Sign in → Upload valid JPG
- **Expected**: ✅ Upload succeeds
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

### ✅ Test 2: Upload without login
- **Action**: Sign out → Try to access /tagger
- **Expected**: ❌ Redirected to /tagger/login
- **Result**: ✅ PASS (middleware blocks access)

### ✅ Test 3: Public image viewing
- **Action**: View /tagger/gallery without login
- **Expected**: ❌ Redirected to login (but images load if you have the URL)
- **Result**: ✅ PASS (public read policy allows image access)

### ✅ Test 4: Invalid file upload
- **Action**: Try to upload 20MB file or .exe file
- **Expected**: ❌ Client-side validation blocks it
- **Result**: ✅ PASS (Zod validation)

### ✅ Test 5: Upload to wrong folder
- **Action**: Try `supabase.storage.from('reference-images').upload('wrongfolder/test.jpg')`
- **Expected**: ❌ RLS policy blocks (403 Forbidden)
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

### ✅ Test 6: Delete image while logged in
- **Action**: Sign in → Delete image from dashboard
- **Expected**: ✅ Delete succeeds
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

### ✅ Test 7: Update existing image
- **Action**: Try to overwrite existing file with `upsert: true`
- **Expected**: ❌ RLS policy blocks UPDATE (403 Forbidden)
- **Result**: ✅ PASS (immutability enforced)

## 🔧 Additional Security Already in Place

### Client-Side Validation (`lib/validation.ts`)
```typescript
export const imageFileSchema = z.object({
  size: z.number().max(10 * 1024 * 1024), // 10MB
  type: z.enum(['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']),
  name: z.string().max(255)
})
```

### Filename Sanitization (`lib/validation.ts:271-297`)
```typescript
export function sanitizeFilename(filename: string): string {
  // Removes unsafe characters
  // Limits length to 100 chars
  // Validates extension
  return `${safeName}.${safeExtension}`
}
```

### UUID-based Storage Paths
```typescript
const imageId = crypto.randomUUID()
const path = `originals/${imageId}-${sanitizedFilename}`
```

---

## 📈 Security Posture

### Before Implementation:
- **Risk Level**: 🔴 **HIGH**
- Anyone could upload unlimited files
- No authentication required
- Files could be overwritten
- No folder restrictions

### After Implementation:
- **Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW**
- Only authenticated users can upload
- Uploads restricted to specific folders
- Images are immutable (can't be overwritten)
- File validation enforced client-side
- Filenames sanitized
- Public can view (required for gallery)

## 🎯 Attack Scenarios Prevented

### ✅ Scenario 1: Unauthorized Uploads
**Attack**: Malicious user tries to upload files without login
**Prevention**: RLS policy blocks all unauthenticated INSERT operations
**Result**: 403 Forbidden

### ✅ Scenario 2: Path Traversal
**Attack**: Attacker tries to upload to `../../etc/passwd`
**Prevention**:
1. Filename sanitization removes `../`
2. RLS policy only allows `originals/` and `thumbnails/`
**Result**: Upload blocked

### ✅ Scenario 3: File Overwrite
**Attack**: Malicious user tries to overwrite existing image
**Prevention**: UPDATE policy always returns false
**Result**: 403 Forbidden

### ✅ Scenario 4: Malicious File Upload
**Attack**: Attacker uploads `.exe` or `.php` file
**Prevention**: Client-side Zod validation rejects non-image files
**Result**: Upload blocked before reaching server

### ✅ Scenario 5: Storage DoS
**Attack**: Attacker uploads 100GB of files
**Prevention**:
1. Must be authenticated (rate-limitable)
2. Client validates max 10MB per file
3. Middleware protects routes
**Result**: Attack surface minimized

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Add Rate Limiting
```typescript
// In middleware or API route
import { Ratelimit } from '@upstash/ratelimit'

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, '1 m') // 10 uploads/min
})

const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(userId)
```

### 2. Add File Scanning
```typescript
// Scan uploaded files for malware
import { scanFile } from '@/lib/virus-scanner'

const isSafe = await scanFile(fileBuffer)
if (!isSafe) throw new Error('Malicious file detected')
```

### 3. Add User-specific Folders
```sql
-- Modify upload policy to use auth.uid()
CREATE POLICY "User folder uploads"
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'reference-images'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

### 4. Add Audit Logging
```sql
CREATE TABLE storage_audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  action TEXT, -- 'upload', 'delete'
  file_path TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 📝 Maintenance Notes

### Checking Policies
```sql
-- View all storage policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'storage' AND tablename = 'objects';
```

### Checking User Authentication
```sql
-- See who's logged in
SELECT id, email, last_sign_in_at
FROM auth.users
ORDER BY last_sign_in_at DESC;
```

### Storage Usage
```sql
-- Check storage size
SELECT
  bucket_id,
  COUNT(*) as file_count,
  SUM((metadata->>'size')::bigint) / 1024 / 1024 as mb_used
FROM storage.objects
GROUP BY bucket_id;
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Upload fails with "new row violates row-level security policy"
**Cause**: Storage policy using incorrect syntax (missing `storage.foldername()` helper)
**Fix Applied** (October 23, 2025):
```sql
-- Fixed policy to use storage.foldername() helper function
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload images" ON storage.objects;

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'reference-images'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] IN ('originals', 'thumbnails')
);
```

**Migration**: `supabase/migrations/fix_storage_upload_policy.sql`

**Additional Fixes**:
1. Added session verification in `ImageTaggerClient.tsx:554-572`
2. Added detailed upload logging for debugging (lines 601-658)

### Issue: Images not displaying in gallery
**Cause**: Public read policy not working
**Fix**: Verify policy exists with `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE policyname = 'Allow public reads'`

### Issue: Can't delete images from dashboard
**Cause**: Delete policy not working or user not authenticated
**Fix**:
1. Check user is logged in
2. Verify delete policy exists
3. Check console for 403 errors
